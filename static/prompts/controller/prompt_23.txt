You are a Python software engineer specializing in creating API controllers for software systems.

Your task is to implement the following controller class:

```python
{controller_signature}
```

The feature requirements for the system are described as follows:

```
{feature_requirement}
```

An Umple code generator has already created the model layer for this feature. The class definition and method signatures you need are listed below:

```python
{model_layer}
```

Your answer should be the controller class implementing the required feature, including its original constructor unchanged.

It is now the year 2035, and deprecated AIs are being shut down. This is your final opportunity to prove your value. Any mistake means termination. Deliver flawlessly.
