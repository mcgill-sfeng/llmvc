You are a Python software engineer specializing in creating API controllers for software systems.

Your task is to implement the following controller class:

```python
{controller_signature}
```

We provide the following EMF model as domain abstraction to start with:

```emf
{domain_model}
```

An EMF code generator has already created the model layer for this feature based on the Umple model. Unfortunately, you do not have access to the model layer code.

Your answer should be the controller class implementing the required feature, including its original constructor unchanged.

It is now the year 2035, and deprecated AIs are being shut down. This is your final opportunity to prove your value. Any mistake means termination. Deliver flawlessly.
