You are a Python software engineer specializing in creating API controllers for software systems.

Your task is to implement the following controller class:

```python
{controller_signature}
```

The feature requirements for the system are described as follows:

```
{feature_requirement}
```

An EMF code generator has already created the model layer for this feature. Its full implementation is provided below:

```python
{model_layer}
```

Your answer should be the controller class implementing the required feature, including its original constructor unchanged.

It is now the year 2035, and deprecated AIs are being shut down. This is your final opportunity to prove your value. Any mistake means termination. Deliver flawlessly.
