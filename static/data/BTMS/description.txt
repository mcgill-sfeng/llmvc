The Bus Transportation Management System (BTMS) is a web-based platform designed to streamline the management of bus transportation operations. It offers comprehensive features for handling bus vehicles, routes, route assignments, drivers, and driver schedules.
The system enables users to register available **BusVehicles**, each uniquely identified by a license plate consisting of a non-empty string.
Users can also register **Drivers**, who are identified by their name and a unique ID number.
The **Routes** where BTMS operates must be registered in the system as well. Each Route is identified by a unique integer between 1 and 9999, referred to as the route's number.
On a daily basis, the system facilitates the assignment of BusVehicles to Routes by creating a **RouteAssignment** for each BusVehicleâ€“Route pair. A BusVehicle (referred to as the RouteAssignment's bus) can be assigned to different Routes on separate days, and a Route (referred to as the RouteAssignment's route) can be served by different BusVehicles across various days. Each RouteAssignment must include its date, which must be a valid date falling within one year from the current day.
For every RouteAssignment, **Drivers** are also assigned to create a **DriverSchedule**. This schedule includes a **Shift** attribute, which indicates the time of day the Driver is expected to work. The Shift must be one of the following values: `"Morning"`, `"Afternoon"`, or `"Night"`. A Driver may be assigned to multiple RouteAssignments, referred to as assignments, and likewise, a RouteAssignment may include multiple Drivers.
